Yo! I'm Kao 👋

I'm just a high schooler who’s super into tech stuff. I like messing around with new operating systems, building random websites, and trying out cool tools I find online.

🧠 Stuff I’m into:
- Playing with different OSes (Linux gang 🐧)
- Making websites for fun
- Learning how things work under the hood

📚 Right now I’m learning:
- HTML, CSS, JS (the usual web dev starter pack)
- Linux basics & some terminal wizardry
- Python (cause everyone starts with it lol)

🚀 Goals:
- Make a personal site that doesn’t look like trash
- Get good at backend stuff
- Maybe drop some open source projects here
